The files in this directory are copied to /config

You can also prepend the filename with @ and the contents will be merged into the matching file (if present)
Note: you need to make sure that those files support "merging" by making sure they include these 2 lines:

/* merged content below */
/* end merged contents */

Good examples of files you would merge into are:

services.php, routes.php, validate.php (rules)
