if you don't want to use these services
it easier to just use these "dummy" stubs for the services

That way when somebody requests the Event service for example they don't get a missing service error.

using the stub as a service

in the __construct()
    
    $this->eventService = Container::get('event');

In a method which needs to call a method on the service
    
    $this->eventService->trigger('load.model');
