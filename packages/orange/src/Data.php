/**
 * Overview of Data.php
 *
 * This file defines the Data class in the orange\framework namespace.
 * It acts as the framework’s centralized data container, designed to hold
 * and manage application-level data in a structured way.
 *
 * ⸻
 *
 * 1. Core Purpose
 * 	•	Implements the DataInterface, which defines the expected contract for a data service in the framework.
 * 	•	Extends SingletonArrayObject, making it both:
 * 	•	A singleton → only one instance exists during runtime.
 * 	•	An enhanced array-like object → allows property-style access ($data->key) as well as array-style access ($data['key']).
 *
 * This makes it the shared data store available across the application lifecycle.
